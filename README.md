# Introduction
July 2020: An investigation of the Sakila Movie Database.

This project is part of the Nanodegree Program "Programming for Data Science with Python" on Udacity

# Description
The queries written in [queries.sql](queries.sql) were used to gather data and populate [the report presentation](Sakila_Database_Investigation.pdf).

[queries.sql](queries.sql) demonstrates the use of common table expressions, subqueries, aggregation functions, JOINs, and GROUP BY clauses to gather relevant data for each question in the investigation.

[The presentation](Sakila_Database_Investigation.pdf) demonstrates how this data can be visualized and what reasonable conclusions may be drawn.
